# Lecture Notes of MIT course 6.s089 – Introduction to Quantum Computing
Quantum computation is a growing ﬁeld at the intersection of physics, computer science, electrical engineering, and applied math. This course provides an introduction to the basics of quantum computation. Speciﬁcally, we will cover some fundamental quantum mechanics, survey quantum circuits, and introduce the most signiﬁcant quantum algorithms. Furthermore, we will survey advanced topics towards the end of the course. In the past, these topics have included quantum error correction, quantum communication, and applications to ﬁelds ranging from machine learning to chemistry. This course is self-contained and does not require any prior knowledge of quantum mechanics.
